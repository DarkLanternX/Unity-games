# Unity-games

Includes the RayCast script and Nightvision controller.

The raycast is added to the flashlight equipped by the player which is used to stun enemies as long as the ray is hitting them, inspired by Alan Wake games
But doing so will empower the enemies(Higher movement speed) when the flashlight is off or facing anything else.
Enemies cannot be seen normally, You can use Night Vision glasses to see enemies but the vieww will be distorted and shaky.
The objective of the level is to escape the hallwawy by figuring out the correct path.
