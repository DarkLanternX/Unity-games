# Unity-games

Includes the RayCast script and Nightvision controller.

The raycast is added to the flashlight equipped by the player which is used to stun enemies as long as the ray is hitting them, inspired by Alan Wake games.
But doing so will empower the enemies(Higher movement speed) when the flashlight is off or facing anything else.
Enemies cannot be seen normally and can only be heard when they are close, You can use Night Vision glasses to see enemies but the view will be distorted and shaky.
This is the base game mechanic for my game.
